<h1>TalTech library</h1>

So, I was supposed to create a website in my class and <br>
I decided to do it about our school library. <p>
<a href="https://www.ttu.ee/asutused/raamatukogu/"> Here is the link to our library webpage. </a> <br>
There you can find out our library opening times. If you are too lazy to click the link, <br>
you can check the times below: <br>
<p>
<table style=width=50%>
  <tr>
    <th>Day of the week</th>
    <th>Opening times </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Monday to Friday</td>
    <td>8:30 - 20:00</td>
  </tr><br>
  <tr>
    <td>Saturday</td>
    <td>11:00 - 18:00</td>
  </tr><br>
  <tr>
    <td>Sunday</td>
    <td>Closed</td>
  </tr><br>
<p>
<h3>It was great to see you here!</h3> <br>
<p>
Bye!<br>
